## 🎨 Code Style Guidelines

### HTML
```html
<!-- Use semantic HTML5 elements -->
<section class="tier tier-1">
    <div class="skill" data-tier="1" data-skill="skill-name">
        <!-- Consistent structure -->
    </div>
</section>
```

### CSS
```css
/* Use consistent naming conventions */
.skill-tree { }  /* Main containers */
.skill-name { }  /* Child elements */
.skill.unlocked { }  /* State modifiers */

/* Mobile-first responsive design */
@media (min-width: 768px) { }
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
// Use clear, descriptive names
function openQuestModal(skillId) { }

// Comment complex logic
// Check if 80% of previous tier is complete
const shouldUnlock = unlockedCount >= Math.floor(total * 0.8);

// Use const/let, not var
const skillData = skillQuests[skillId];
```

## 🌳 Creating a New Skill Tree

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Plan Your Content**
   - List 20-30 skills
   - Group into 4-6 tiers
   - Write 3-5 quests per skill
   - Find 2-3 resources per skill

2. **Use the Template**
   ```bash
   cp index.html your-skill-tree.html
   ```

3. **Modify the Content**
   - Update the title and heading
   - Change color scheme if desired
   - Replace skill data
   - Update tier names

4. **Structure Your Skills Object**
   ```javascript
   const skillQuests = {
       'unique-skill-id': {
           icon: '🎯',
           quests: {
               'Hands-On Practice': [
                   'Build X without help',
                   'Configure Y from scratch'
               ],
               'Theory & Concepts': [
                   'Understand principle A',
                   'Explain concept B'
               ]
           },
           resources: [
               { name: 'Official Docs', url: 'https://...' },
               { name: 'Video Tutorial', url: 'https://...' }
           ]
       }
   };
   ```

5. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Check all skills are clickable
   - Verify quest tracking works
   - Ensure tier unlocking functions
   - Test on mobile devices

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] All skills open modal when clicked
- [ ] Quest checkboxes save state
- [ ] Progress bar updates correctly
- [ ] Tier unlocking works (80% rule)
- [ ] localStorage persists on refresh
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Resources links work
- [ ] Proper contrast for accessibility

## 📚 Resource Guidelines

When adding learning resources:

### ✅ Good Resources
- Free and accessible
- High quality content
- Official documentation
- Reputable platforms (Microsoft Learn, freeCodeCamp, etc.)
- Interactive tutorials
- Updated regularly

### ❌ Avoid
- Paid courses (unless there's a free tier)
- Outdated content (>2 years old for tech)
- Low quality or spam sites
- Resources requiring signup
- Pirated content

## 🎯 Quest Writing Tips

### Good Quests
```javascript
'Build Without Help': [
    'Create a REST API with authentication',  // Specific
    'Deploy an app to Azure App Service',     // Actionable
    'Write unit tests with 80% coverage'      // Measurable
]
```

### Avoid Vague Quests
```javascript
// Too vague:
'Learn about APIs'
'Understand deployment'
'Know testing'
```
